         <p className="bio"> Born in Kalamazoo, Michigan to a family of artists, Tardy spent much of her young life involved in art programs and summer camps, including those offered by the Kalamazoo Institute of Art, and received continual inspiration from her mother and grandmother.  In 1999, she moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan to attend the distinguished Kendall College of Art and Design where she earned her BFA and made a name for herself with her lifelike sketches, soulful paintings and uncanny ability to capture the essence of a moment in a photo.  Tardy’s art came to embody the vision articulated by artist and painter Jeffrey Smart, who stated, “It’s not a matter of painting life, it’s a matter of giving life to painting.” </p>
